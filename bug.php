This code uses the mysql_* functions, which are deprecated and have been removed from recent PHP versions.  Using them can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. The code attempts to connect to a MySQL database, execute a query, and fetch results, but will fail if the mysql_* extension is not enabled or the MySQL server is unavailable.  Error handling is minimal or absent which will cause the script to abruptly stop without clear indication of the problem. 
```php
<?php
$link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'user', 'password');
if (!$link) {
die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
}
echo 'Connected successfully';
mysql_select_db('mydatabase');
$result = mysql_query('SELECT * FROM mytable');
if (!$result) {
die('Could not query: ' . mysql_error());
}
while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
    print_r($row);
}
mysql_close($link);
?>
```
