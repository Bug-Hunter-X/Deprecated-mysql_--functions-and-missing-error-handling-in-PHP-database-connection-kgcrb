This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP code: the use of deprecated `mysql_*` functions for database interaction. The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code. This code is vulnerable because the `mysql_*` extension is deprecated and may not be available in newer PHP versions. The code also lacks proper error handling, leading to abrupt script termination upon failures.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version using the more modern and secure `mysqli_*` functions (or PDO), along with improved error handling for a robust and secure database interaction.  This example highlights the importance of using up-to-date database libraries and implementing comprehensive error handling to prevent unexpected behavior and security risks in PHP applications.
